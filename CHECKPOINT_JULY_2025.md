# Commission Reconciliation System - Checkpoint July 2025

## System Version: 3.0

### Executive Summary

The Commission Reconciliation Tool has been significantly enhanced to handle complex commission structures including withholding transactions, forecast deals, and split commissions. The system now processes 580 transactions across multiple types and correctly identifies 308 centrally processed deals.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Enhanced Transaction Support
- ✅ **Withholding Transactions**: 135 transactions with €32,917 withheld (50/50 split)
- ✅ **Forecast Transactions**: 86 future quarter projections with kicker support
- ✅ **Split Transactions**: 229 deals divided across quarters
- ✅ **Regular Transactions**: 130 standard commission entries

### 2. Improved Validation Logic
- ✅ Changed to use SalesCookie rates as source of truth
- ✅ Formula: `SalesCookie ACV × SalesCookie Rate = Expected Commission`
- ✅ No longer relies on pre-configured rates

### 3. Centrally Processed Deal Recognition
- ✅ Identifies 308 FP/CPI increase deals
- ✅ Detection patterns: 'cpi increase', 'fp increase', 'fixed price increase', 'indexation'
- ✅ Properly excludes from matching process

### 4. Enhanced Reporting
- ✅ Added Discrepancy % column with color coding
  - Red: >50% variance
  - Orange: 20-50% variance
  - Black: ≤20% variance
- ✅ Fixed Excel #VALUE! errors
- ✅ Transaction type breakdowns in summary

### 5. New Utilities
- ✅ `combine_salescookie_files.py` - Merges all CSV sources
- ✅ Handles multiple file formats and naming conventions
- ✅ Adds metadata (Quarter, Source_File, Transaction_Type)

### 6. Split Transaction Fix (July 30)
- ✅ Enhanced `_match_splits()` to create new matches
- ✅ Improved match rate from 59.5% to 84.7%
- ✅ Reduced discrepancies by 48 deals
- ✅ Fixed deal 35852463762 and similar split-first deals

## Usage Workflow

```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Combine all SalesCookie files
python combine_salescookie_files.py

# 3. Run reconciliation
python reconcile_v3.py \
  --hubspot-file ../salescookie_manual/tb-deals.csv \
  --salescookie-file all_salescookie_credits.csv \
  --output-dir reports_v3

# 4. Review reports in reports_v3/
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. **Remove FP/CPI deals from HubSpot** - 32 deals worth €280k shouldn't be there
2. **Improve HubSpot export** - Filter out centrally processed deals
3. **Monitor withholding** - €32,917 currently withheld, ensure proper release
4. **Review high discrepancies** - Focus on deals with >50% variance

### Potential Enhancements
1. Automated HubSpot data cleaning
2. Real-time commission tracking dashboard
3. Integration with SalesCookie API
4. Automated email reporting

4. Discrepancy % calculation added
5. FP Increase pattern added to detection

### Performance Metrics
- Processing time: <5 seconds for 580 transactions
