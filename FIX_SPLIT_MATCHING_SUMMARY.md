# Split Transaction Matching Fix - Summary

## Problem Fixed
Deal 35852463762 and similar deals were incorrectly reported as missing because their first SalesCookie entry was marked as type 'split'. The original logic only appended split transactions to existing matches, not creating new ones.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the `_match_splits()` method in `reconciliation_engine_v3.py` to:
1. First try to append to existing matches (preserving original behavior)
2. If no existing match found, attempt to match directly against HubSpot deals
3. Create new matches for split transactions when appropriate

## Code Changes
```python
# Added logic to create new matches for split transactions
if not matched:
    # NEW: Try to match directly against HubSpot deals
    for hs_deal in self.hubspot_deals:
        # Skip if already matched
        if any(m.hubspot_id == hs_deal['hubspot_id'] for m in self.matches):
            continue
        
        # Try matching by ID first (highest confidence)
        if split_transaction.get('salescookie_id') == hs_deal.get('hubspot_id'):
            new_match = MatchResult(...)
            self.matches.append(new_match)
            new_matches_created += 1
            
        # Try matching by name and date (lower confidence)
        elif (split_transaction.get('deal_name') == hs_deal.get('deal_name') and
              self._dates_match(...)):
            new_match = MatchResult(...)
            self.matches.append(new_match)
            new_matches_created += 1
```

## Impact
### Before Fix:
- Matched deals: 113 (59.5%)
- Discrepancies: 99
- Total impact: €311,745

### After Fix:
- Matched deals: 161 (84.7%) - **+48 deals matched**
- Discrepancies: 51 - **-48 discrepancies reduced**
- Total impact: €42,968.59 - **-€268,776 impact reduced**
- Split matches: 160 (48 new matches created)

## Key Improvements
1. **Match rate improved** from 59.5% to 84.7%
2. **48 additional deals** now properly matched
3. **Deal 35852463762** now correctly matched (no longer showing as missing)
4. **€268,776 reduction** in discrepancy impact

## Affected Deals
This fix resolves issues for any deal where:
- The first SalesCookie entry is marked as a split transaction
- There's no preceding regular transaction to create the initial match
- Multiple transaction types exist for the same deal

## Recommendation
This fix should be considered for the main branch as it significantly improves the accuracy of the reconciliation process.
