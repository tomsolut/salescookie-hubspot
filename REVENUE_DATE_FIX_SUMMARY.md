# CPI/FP Increase Revenue Start Date Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
CPI and FP increase deals must have revenue start dates on January 1st of the year following their close date, according to business rules:
- These increases are set twice per year
- Revenue always starts January 1st of the following year

## Analysis Results
Out of 308 CPI/FP increase deals:
- **294 deals (95.5%)** had correct January dates
- **14 deals (4.5%)** had incorrect dates

### Incorrect Patterns Found:
1. **April starts (3 deals)**: Close in December 2023 → Revenue April 2024 (should be January 2024)
2. **March starts (2 deals)**: Close in August 2024 → Revenue March 2025 (should be January 2025)
3. **July starts (2 deals)**: Close in May 2025 → Revenue July 2025 (should be January 2026)
4. **October starts (2 deals)**: Close in July 2025 → Revenue October 2025 (should be January 2026)
5. **February starts (5 deals)**: Close in May 2025 → Revenue February 2026 (should be January 2026)

## Fix Applied
Created `fix_increase_revenue_dates.py` which:
1. Identifies all CPI/FP increase deals
2. Calculates correct revenue start date (January 1st of year after close)
3. Fixes incorrect dates
4. Saves corrected data to `all_salescookie_credits_fixed.csv`
5. Creates change log in `revenue_date_fixes.csv`

## Examples of Fixes:
| Deal | Close Date | Old Revenue | New Revenue |

## Impact

- Revenue dates now follow the business rule consistently
- This ensures proper commission accrual timing

## Next Steps
1. Use `all_salescookie_credits_fixed.csv` for reconciliation
2. Add validation to prevent future incorrect dates
3. Consider automating this check in the data import process
