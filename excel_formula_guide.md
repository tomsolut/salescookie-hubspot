## Excel Formula Explanation

The formula `=IF(E2>0, F2/E2, 0)` does the following:
- `IF(E2>0, ...)` - Checks if Amount (column E) is greater than 0
- `F2/E2` - Divides SC Total Commission (F) by Amount (E)
- `0` - Returns 0 if Amount is 0 (to avoid division by zero)

Excel automatically converts to percentage when you apply percentage formatting.

- Very high or very low percentages indicate calculation errors
